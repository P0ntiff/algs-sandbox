'''

We are designing an escape room game and we have a 2D map representing the room using an integer matrix. Each cell can be either a wall (denoted by a 1) or an empty space (0).

escape_room = [
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1],
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
  [0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
]

The player in our escape room can move 1 space at a time â€“ up, down, left, or right. The player can't land on a wall or go through walls or move through the edges of the escape room.

Write a function which takes the escape_room and a starting_position (a row-column pair). This function should return all of the next immediately available positions that the player can move.

Example 1:
Input: findLegalMoves(escape_room, (1, 1))
Output: (0, 1), (1, 0)

Example 2: 
Input: findLegalMoves(escape_room, (5, 3))
Output: (5, 2), (5, 4), (4, 3), (6, 3)

Example 3: 
Input: findLegalMoves(escape_room, (5, 1))
Output:  (6, 1), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 2)

Example 4: 
Input: findLegalMoves(escape_room, (6, 0))
Output: (5, 0), (6, 1)

Example 5: 
Input: findLegalMoves(escape_room, (6, 4))
Output: (5, 4), (6, 3)

Example 6: 
Input: findLegalMoves(escape_room, (0, 0))
Output: (0, 1), (1, 0)

Example 7: 
Input: findLegalMoves(escape_room, (2, 2))
Output: [ ] # no moves possible

Given an escape room and the exit, determine if it is possible for a player to always get out of the room regardless of where their starting point is. 

Note that you're *not* actually given the starting point of the player, instead you have to assume the player could start anywhere. 

It is up to you to determine if it is possible to travel from *every* open cell in the room to the exit regardless of where the player starts.

Ideas: Shortest path (Dijkstra's algorithm). This won't work because it's greedy, and I need to ensure every route with clues is fully checked.

Backtracking, can check every possible path and check if every clue was collected. Only real solution because the problem is NP-complete, i.e. TSP.  You can't do better than exponential. 

Decision tree:
From starting point, try each available direction. Track the current path we're on so we don't double back on ourselves.

At a leaf node when we can't go any further in a direction. Backtrack and try another direction.

Track as we go the current path we're on, in a set for O(1) lookup

When at a leaf node, check if we've reached the exit and collected all keys
 - Update the shortest path if this is shorter than the shortest known path

Great! We now have an escape room that can be escaped from and a way to traverse it effectively. Your final task is the most challenging.

In every escape room, there are open spaces (0) and walls (1) but now there also will be clues (2). An escape room cannot be properly escaped from until a player has first found *all* of the clues.

Given an escape room, a starting point, and an exit, write a function to return the shortest simple path of open spaces from the start to the exit, if such a path even exists. If multiple paths exist return any of the valid paths.

*Important*
- A simple path is one that does not revist any location (i.e. you can't step on the same cell twice!)
- A path is not considered valid unless you collect all of the clues
- While returning any path is a start towards solving the problem, we are looking for the *shortest* path that collects all the clues and does not revist any locations.
